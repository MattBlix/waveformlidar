\title{which.half: calculate the position of half total energy position}
\usage{
which.half(x, normalization = "TRUE")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{is the waveform intensities. If you have other information, you should delete these intensites before you run this function .}

\item{normalization}{is determine whether you want to normalized the waveform intensity or not. Here we used the minimum intensity to conduct normalization. Default is use the normalized data.}
}
\value{
return the index of half total energy position of waveform.
}
\description{
The function allows you to identify the half total energy position which can be used to calculate the height from waveform ending or waveform begining.
}
\examples{

data(return)
x<-return[1,]
#default
which.half(x)
#NOT USE normalization
which.half(x,normalization="TRUE")
}
