Description: The waveformlidar package provides functions to process waveform LiDAR data 
    with decomposition or deconvolution methods. For the decomposition, multiple functions 
    such as Gaussian, adaptive Gaussian and Weibull functions are available for directly 
    decomposing waveforms. There are two deconvolution methods included for waveform 
    deconvolution in this package: Richard-Lucy (RL) and Gold algorithms. In addition, 
    there are several functions are available for extracting waveform-related variables 
    from raw waveforms, which can be beneficial for characterizing the waveform for 
    tree species identification, biomass estimation and vegetation characterization.
