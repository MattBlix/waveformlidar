**Overview**
---
A wealth of Full Waveform (FW) LiDAR data are available to the public from different sources, which is poised to boost the extensive application of FW LiDAR data. However, we lack a handy and open source tool that can be used by potential users for processing and analyzing FW LiDAR data. To this end, we introduce *waveformlidar*, an R package dedicated to FW LiDAR processing, analysis and visualization as a solution to the constraint. Specifically, this package provides several commonly used waveform processing methods such as Gaussian, adaptive Gaussian and Weibull decompositions, and deconvolution approaches (Gold and Richard-Lucy (RL)) with usersâ€™ customized settings. In addition, we also develop some functions to derive commonly used waveform metrics for characterizing vegetation structure. Moreover, a new way to directly visualize FW LiDAR data is developed through converting waveforms into points to form the Hyper Point cloud (HPC), which can be easily adopted and subsequently analyzed with existing discrete-return LiDAR processing tools such as LAStools and FUSION. Basic explorations of the HPC such as 3D voxelization of the HPC and conversion from original waveforms to composite waveforms are also available in this package. All of these functions are developed based on small-footprint FW LiDAR data, but they can be easily transplanted to the large footprint FW LiDAR data such as Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) and Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) data analysis. 


**Install waveformlidar**
---
The current developmental version can be downloaded from github via  
```
if (!require("devtools")) {  
  install.packages("devtools")  
}  
devtools::install_github("tankwin08/waveformlidar", dependencies = TRUE)  

``` 


**How to use waveformlidar**
---
As a brief introduction, we conduct Gaussian decomposition on several waveforms to extarct useful information from the wavefomrs. In addition, we also examplify the waveforms on decompostion method with GOLD and RL methods. The detailed description of these methods has been documented in our previous reserach (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2017.04.021). 
Furthermore, we also demonstrate how to generate Hyper Point Cloud (HPC) from a sample waveform dataset at a small region.

*Decomposition*
We used two waveforms as an example to demonstrate how to conduct Gaussian, adaptive and Weibull decompositon with differnt preprocessing settings.

```
library(data.table)
data(return)
wf<-data.table(index=c(1:nrow(return)),return)
###################################################################################################
#decomposition two examples: one is the simple waveform and another was more complex waveform
r1<- decom(wf[1,])    ##default, with smooth was applied
r2<- decom(wf[1,], smooth = FALSE)  ##use the raw waveform

##for more complicated waveform
r3<- decom(wf[182,])
##when the waveform is mixed with too much noise, we should consider use more filtering options
r4<- decom(wf[182,],smooth=TRUE,width=5)
###we also can fit the waveform with the other models such as adaptive Gaussian and Weibull
r5<-decom.adaptive(wf[182,])
r6<-decom.weibull(wf[182,])
