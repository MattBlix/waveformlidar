# waveformlidar
The waveformlidar package provides functions to process waveform lidar data with decompostion or deconvolution methods. Fmutiple functions such as Gaussian, adative Gaussian and Weibull function, 
In additon, there are several functions are used to extract waveform-realted variables from raw waveforms which can be used to charcterize the
